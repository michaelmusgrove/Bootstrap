            <h1><a href="#">How to Build a Bootstrap Website, from Photoshop to WordPress</a></h1>
                <p>This is a very thorough presentation of how to build a Bootstrap website using WordPress as a CMS. It's a 24 part series (I told you it was thorough) and easy to follow along with.</p>
                <p>If you bought the Bootstrap book, hopefully you've seen the resources in the back for everything you may ever need to set up a Boostrap site. I'd recommend following along with this Bootstrap tutorial if you're a total beginnner.</p>
                <p>Integrating Bootstrap and WordPress can be a bit tricky, at least as of this writing. There are a couple of WordPress-based Bootstrap themes(or Bootstrap-based WordPress themes, more accurately), but personally I haven't found one I'm in love with.</p>
                <p>I'd recommend setting aside some time each day and following closely along with this Bootstrap tutorial, and you'll be way ahead of the game in a relatively small amount of time, considering everything you'll learn.</p>

            <h1><a href="#">Some Information for Those That Have Bought The Bootstrap Book (Or Plan To)</a></h1>
                <p>Well, the launch of the book was kind of a humbling, and sputtering, adventure. It seems that the source files that accompany the book weren't propogating on the site. That means a couple of things, which I'd like to point out here at the get-go, have been resolved.</p>
                <p>Something I wrestled with the publishers about was how to go about formatting code, so it would be easy to read and the most useful for you, the reader. Essentially I was told to do the best I can and that was it. Thanks!</p>
                <p>The format the book is in that of a 6x9 inch layout. The screen that the code was on was a 27 inch widescreen monitor that's able to present a lot of pixels, which is great under most circumstances. When you need to take a screenshot of what normally would be several pages of code and then cram it into a 6x9 page, with one inch margins, it becomes a challenge.</p>
                <p>Those of you who have already bought the book have surely noticed, and I even pointed out apologetically, that several of the screenshots, out of around 100, have microscopic text. I decided to include them not to strain readers' eyes, but to provide a <strong>very</strong> general guideline of where we were in the text, and match it to the available source code.</p>
                <p>That seemed like a reasonable solution. Problem was, some readers couldn't access the source code, so they were left with not only having to squint and read that code, but didn't have the code to copy/paste or manipulate while going through the book. That pretty much makes the book worthless (which was pointed out by a reader on Amazon in my first review, unfortunately.)</p>
                <p>I contacted my host and managed to solve the problem, but I'm afraid it may be too late after that review. My sales definitely have come to a halt, which is unfortunate, but that's how it goes sometimes.</p>
                <p>So, if you'd like to buy the book, please be aware there are a couple, and I do mean very few, small screenshots. But they're of the exact code that comes with the book. If you are on the fence about it, please take a look at the code that I've made freely available to go with the book. It may be accessed at <a href="http://freebootstrap.com/resources/">FreeBootstrap.com/Resources</a>.</p>
                <p>Also, as a way of saying I'm sorry to those readers and hopefully regain some good faith, I have a free Bootstrap theme I've made available. It can be downloaded over at <a href="http://bootzap.com">BootZap</a>. It's a smooth-scrolling one page style theme, with several different sections to showcase a portfolio, products, video, or whatever. It has some really cool Metro styling and is free for the taking.</p>
                <p>So, lesson learned. Before a launch of any sort, make <strong>SURE</strong> everything is tied down tight.</p>

    <h2>Who's been busy? This guy.</h2>
                 <p>Down with the Lorem Ipsum, up with some actual content on this site, finally. Over the past several weeks, I've somehow managed to write a quite authoritative, 170+ page book on how to use Twitter Bootstrap, build out several sites, and create a new theme for Bootstrap, which I'm giving out for free.</p>
                 <p>The book was the work of a man on a mission. I wrote it, edited it well over 10 times word-by-word, designed the book cover (both front and back, and spine) which is probably evident, and formatted it for Kindle, the Apple store, Barnes &amp; Noble and everyone else's tablets and readers. If there's one thing worse than editing someone else's work, which I've done a <strong>lot</strong> of over the years, it's editing your own over and over. Oh, and I also illustrated it.</p>
                 <p>There is currently only one specific book on how to nail Twitter Bootstrap on the market I could find, and it isn't exactly getting rave reviews. It seems mostly due to being more of a "booklet" which just rips everything off Bootstrap's site. I'd be pissed if I bought that, too. So, it was time to do something about that, and as an English major and manic nutjob, I wrote my own book, which just hit the actual and virtual shelves.</p>
                 <p>In order to promote said book, I needed a decent site, so I built two: this one and <a href="http://bootzap.com">BootZap.com</a>. This one is mostly a storefront for the book, although I offer my free themes here too, hidden away up there in the dropdown menu. BootZap will be where I house themes and other goodies I make for Bootstrap. I'm not in it for the money, because there isn't any. The royalties from the book are nothing, and the Bootstrap theme market isn't exactly on fire.</p>
                 <p>Of course, as I put the finishing touches on the book I realized Bootstrap 3 is going to be appearing soon, bringing with it some pretty big changes. That means, of course, more writing, editing, designing, etc...but I'm happy to do it. Obviously I really like Bootstrap, and truly believe that the more people that are on board with it, the better. Being one of the more popular frameworks out there, I think it has the potential to be something quite big, at least among the designer and dev crowds. Not exactly WordPress big, which is <em><strong>BIG</strong></em> since WP doesn't require you to really know much about building sites. You just choose a theme, add your favorite plugins, write some blather, and post it. I love WordPress; don't get me wrong. There are also currently eleventy-billion themes and plugins for WordPress, so I don't feel compelled to add to those numbers the way I do with Bootstrap.</p>
                 <p>I've sold a few copies already, so I'm eager to get some reviews on it. I don't expect them to be amazing, as a first work, but the criticism will help what I release for Bootstrap version 3 be better. In that same vein, I'm going to be asking around the interwebs what sorts of themes and toys people want for Bootstrap. A common complaint with many sites that use a CMS or framework is that they all look alike, or at least you can pick them out of a lineup too easily, which makes some people groan when their names are mentioned. That's due to the users either not taking the time to design it out properly, or just not knowing how. I aim to address the latter.</p>
                 <p>So, that being said, I've got some work to do. I realize I need to clean the construction dust off this site, so pardon the mess, as the signs always say. In the meantime, if there's something you'd like to see for Bootstrap(I'm dropping the "Twitter," just for the record) please let me know. I'm on Twitter, coincidentally, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/#!/getbootstrap/">@GetBootstrap.</a> so look me up.</p>
